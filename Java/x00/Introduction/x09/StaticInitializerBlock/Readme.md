# Java Static Initializer Block

Static initialization blocks are executed when the class is loaded, and you can initialize static variables in those blocks.

It's time to test your knowledge of *Static initialization blocks*. You can read about it [here.](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/initial.html)

You are given a class *Solution* with a *main* method. Complete the given code so that it outputs the area of a parallelogram with breadth **B** and height **H**. You should read the variables from the standard input.

If **B <= 0** or **H <= 0**, the output should be *"java.lang.Exception: Breadth and height must be positive"* without quotes.
