# Java End-of-file

> "In computing, *End Of File* (commonly abbreviated *EOF*) is a condition in a computer operating system where no more data can be read from a data source." â€” ([Wikipedia: End-of-file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-file))

The challenge here is to read **n** lines of input until you reach *EOF*, then number and print all **n** lines of content.

**Hint:** Java's *Scanner.hasNext()* method is helpful for this problem.
