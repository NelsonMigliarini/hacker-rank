# Comparator

Comparators are used to compare two objects. In this challenge, you'll create a comparator and use it to sort an array.

The *Player* class is provided for you in your editor. It has **2** fields: a **name **String and a **score** integer.

Given an array of **n** Player* objects, write a comparator that sorts them in order of decreasing score; if **2** or more players have the same score, sort those players alphabetically by name. To do this, you must create a *Checker* class that implements the *Comparator* interface, then write an *int compare(Player a, Player b)* method implementing the [Comparator.compare(T o1, T o2)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html#compare(T, T)) method.
