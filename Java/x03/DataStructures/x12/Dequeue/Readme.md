# Dequeue

In computer science, a double-ended queue (dequeue, often abbreviated to deque, pronounced deck) is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue, for which elements can be added to or removed from either the front (head) or back (tail).

Deque interfaces can be implemented using various types of collections such as `LinkedList` or `ArrayDeque` classes. For example, deque can be declared as:

```
Deque deque = new LinkedList<>();
or
Deque deque = new ArrayDeque<>();
```

You can find more details about Deque [here](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Deque.html).

In this problem, you are given **N** integers. You need to find the maximum number of unique integers among all the possible contiguous subarrays of size **M**.

*Note*: Time limit is **3** second for this problem.
