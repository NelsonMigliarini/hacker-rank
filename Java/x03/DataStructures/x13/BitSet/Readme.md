# BitSet

Java's [BitSet](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/BitSet.html) class implements a vector of bit values (i.e.: **false**(**0**) or **true**(**1**)) that grows as needed, allowing us to easily manipulate bits while optimizing space (when compared to other collections). Any element having a bit value of **1** is called a *set bit*.

Given **2** BitSets, **B<sub>1</sub>** and **B<sub>2</sub>**, of size **N** where all bits in both BitSets are initialized to **o**, perform a series of **M** operations. After each operation, print the number of *set bits* in the respective BitSets as two space-separated integers on a new line.
