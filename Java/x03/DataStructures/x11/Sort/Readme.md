# Sort

You are given a list of student information: ID, FirstName, and CGPA. Your task is to rearrange them according to their CGPA in decreasing order. If two student have the same CGPA, then arrange them according to their first name in alphabetical order. If those two students also have the same first name, then order them according to their ID. No two students have the same ID.

**Hint**: You can use comparators to sort a list of objects. See the [oracle docs](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/order.html) to learn about comparators.
