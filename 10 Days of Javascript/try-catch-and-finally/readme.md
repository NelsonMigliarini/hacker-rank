# Try, Catch, and Finally

## Objective

In this challenge, we learn about _strings_ and _exceptions_. Check out the attached tutorials for more details.

## Task

Complete the _reverseString_ function; it has one parameter, **s**. You must perform the following actions:

1. _Try_ to reverse string **s** using the _split_, _reverse_, and _join_ methods.
2. If an exception is thrown, _catch_ it and print the contents of the exception's **message** on a new line.
3. Print **s** on a new line. If no exception was thrown, then this should be the reversed string; if an exception was thrown, this should be the original string.
