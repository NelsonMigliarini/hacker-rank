# Day 0: Data Types

## Objective

Today, we're discussing data types. Check out the attached [tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/js10-data-types/topics) for more details.

## Task

Variables named **firstInteger**, **firstDecimal**, and **firstString** are declared for you in the editor below. You must use the **+** operator to perform the following sequence of operations:

1. Convert **secondInteger** to an integer (Number type), then sum it with **firstInteger** and print the result on a new line using `console.log`.
2. Convert **secondDecimal** to a floating-point number (Number type), then sum it with **firstDecimal** and print the result on a new line using `console.log`.
3. Print the concatenation of **firstString** and **secondString** on a new line using `console.log`. Note that **firstString** _must_ be printed first.
