# Let and Const

## Objective

In this challenge, we practice declaring variables using the _let_ and _const_ keywords. Check out the attached [tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/js10-let-and-const/topics) for more details.

## Task

1. Declare a _constant variable_, **PI**, and assign it the value _Math.PI_. You will not pass this challenge unless the variable is declared as a constant and named `PI` (uppercase).
2. Read a number, **r**, denoting the radius of a circle from stdin.
3. Use **PI** and **r** to calculate the **area** and **perimeter** of a circle having radius **r**.
4. Print **area** as the first line of output and print **perimeter** as the second line of output.
