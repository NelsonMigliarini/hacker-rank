# Loops

## Objective

In this challenge, we practice looping over the characters of string. Check out the attached [tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/js10-loops/topics) for more details.

## Task

Complete the _vowelsAndConsonants_ function in the editor below. It has one parameter, a string, **s**, consisting of lowercase English alphabetic letters (i.e., `a` through `z`). The function must do the following:

1. First, print each _vowel_ in **s** on a new line. The English vowels are _a_, _e_, _i_, _o_, and _u_, and each vowel must be printed in the same order as it appeared in **s**.
2. Second, print each _consonant_ (i.e., non-vowel) in **s** on a new line in the same order as it appeared in **s**.
