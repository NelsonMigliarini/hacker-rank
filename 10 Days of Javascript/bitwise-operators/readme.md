# Bitwise Operators

## Objective

Today, we're practicing bitwise operations. Check the attached tutorial for more details.

## Task

We define **S** to be a sequence of distinct sequential integers from **1** to **n**; in other words, **S = {1,2,3,...,n}**. We want to know the maximum bitwise AND value of any two integers, **a** and **b** (where **a < b**), in sequence **S** that is also less than a given integer, **k**.

Complete the function in the editor so that given **n** and **k**, it returns the maximum **a & b < k**.

Note: The  symbol represents the bitwise AND operator.
