# Try, Catch, and Finally

**Objective**

In this challenge, we learn about *strings* and *exceptions*. Check out the attached tutorials for more details.

**Task**

Complete the *reverseString* function; it has one parameter, **s**. You must perform the following actions:

1. *Try* to reverse string **s** using the *split*, *reverse*, and *join* methods.
2. If an exception is thrown, *catch* it and print the contents of the exception's **message** on a new line.
3. Print **s** on a new line. If no exception was thrown, then this should be the reversed string; if an exception was thrown, this should be the original string.
