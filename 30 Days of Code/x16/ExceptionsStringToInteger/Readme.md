# Exceptions - String to Integer

**Objective**

Today, we're getting started with Exceptions by learning how to parse an integer from a string and print a custom error message. Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-exceptions-string-to-integer/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

**Task**

Read a string, **S**, and print its integer value; if **S** cannot be converted to an integer, print Bad String.

**Note:** You must use the String-to-Integer and exception handling constructs built into your submission language. If you attempt to use loops/conditional statements, you will get a **0** score.
