# Dictionaries and Maps

**Objective**

Today, we're learning about Key-Value pair mappings using a Map or Dictionary data structure. Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-dictionaries-and-maps/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

**Task**

Given **n** names and phone numbers, assemble a phone book that maps friends' names to their respective phone numbers. You will then be given an unknown number of names to query your phone book for. For each **name** queried, print the associated entry from your phone book on a new line in the form name=phoneNumber; if an entry for **name** is not found, print Not found instead.

**Note:** Your phone book should be a Dictionary/Map/HashMap data structure.
