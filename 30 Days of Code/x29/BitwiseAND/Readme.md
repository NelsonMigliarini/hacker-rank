**Objective**
Welcome to the last day! Today, we're discussing bitwise operations. Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-bitwise-and/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

**Task**
Given set **S = {1, 2, 3, ..., N}**. Find two integers, **A** and **B** (where **A < B**), from set **S** such that the value of **A & B** is the maximum possible *and also less than a given integer,* **K**. In this case, **&** represents the *bitwise AND* operator.
