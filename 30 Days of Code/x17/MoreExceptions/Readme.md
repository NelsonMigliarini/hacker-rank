# More Exceptions

**Objective**

Yesterday's challenge taught you to manage exceptional situations by using try and catch blocks. In today's challenge, you're going to practice throwing and propagating an exception. Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-more-exceptions/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

**Task**

Write a Calculator class with a single method: int power(int,int). The power method takes two integers, **n** and **p**, as parameters and returns the integer result of **n<sup>p</sup>**. If either **n** or **p** is negative, then the method must throw an exception with the message: n and p should be non-negative.

**Note:** Do not use an access modifier (e.g.: public) in the declaration for your Calculator class.
