# Running Time and Complexity

**Objective**
Today we're learning about running time! Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-running-time-and-complexity/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

**Task**
A *prime* is a natural number greater than **1** that has no positive divisors other than **1** and itself. Given a number, **n**, determine and print whether it's **Prime** or **Not prime**.

**Note:** If possible, try to come up with a **O(âˆšn)** primality algorithm, or see what sort of optimizations you come up with for an **O(n)** algorithm. Be sure to check out the *Editorial* after submitting your code!
