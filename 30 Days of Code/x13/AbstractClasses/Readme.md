# Abstract Classes

**Objective**

Today, we're taking what we learned yesterday about [Inheritance](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/subclasses.html) and extending it to [Abstract Classes](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/abstract.html). Because this is a very specific Object-Oriented concept, submissions are limited to the few languages that use this construct. Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-abstract-classes/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

**Task**

Given a Book class and a Solution class, write a MyBook class that does the following:
- Inherits from Book
- Has a parameterized constructor taking these **3** parameters:
  1. string **title**
  2. string **author**
  3. int **price** 
- Implements the Book class' abstract display() method so it prints these **3** lines:
  1. **Title:**, a space, and then the current instance's **title**.
  2. **Author:**, a space, and then the current instance's **author**.
  3. **Price:**, a space, and then the current instance's **price**.

**Note:** Because these classes are being written in the same file, you must not use an access modifier (e.g.: **public**) when declaring MyBook or your code will not execute.
