# Generics

**Objective**

Today we're discussing Generics; be aware that not all languages support this construct, so fewer languages are enabled for this challenge. Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-generics/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

**Task**

Write a single generic function named printArray; this function must take an array of generic elements as a parameter (the exception to this is C++, which takes a vector). The locked Solution class in your editor tests your function.

**Note:** You must use generics to solve this challenge. Do not write overloaded functions.
