# Time Complexity: Primality

A *prime* is a natural number *greater than* **1** that has no positive divisors other than **1** and itself. Given **p** integers, determine the primality of each integer and print whether it is `Prime` or `Not prime` on a new line.

**Note:** If possible, try to come up with an **O(âˆšn)** primality algorithm, or see what sort of optimizations you can come up with for an **O(n)**algorithm. Be sure to check out the *Editorial* after submitting your code! 

**Function Description**

Complete the *primality* function in the editor below. It should return `Prime` if **n** is prime, or `Not prime`.

primality has the following parameter(s):

- *n*: an integer to test for primality
